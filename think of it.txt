What’s Your “One Word” for the Year Ahead?

Have you heard of the “one word” challenge? People pray for one word that encapsulates what they want to work on this year.

I definitely know my one word for the next year. It’s PASSION. I’ve felt lately that I need more passion in my life: 
passion for God, passion for nature, passion for my husband, passion for my family. I’ve been living my life lately too much by 
rote, pushing myself to do what needs to get done, and I’ve forgotten how to be passionate about it.


For me one word would be CSE.....I wont leave without giving it a chance....



I should not waste my time and energy in these things..remember your goal your target... so dont indulge in these sloppy things.

ITS NOT MY LAST RESORT TO LAY ON!! SO GO ON..GO ON..GO ON...
          CANT STOP...WONT STOP!!
  
Think of those who dont have money to spent...dont have time to spent....dont have friends to chill...dont have family to love...
those who are suffering from severe illness like aids n alll blah blah...u know....so these things should not be OVERDONE..
Enjoy Life...

Think of LIFE BEHIND BARS...

u have so many other things to enjoy...they are more pleasurable and enjoyable...
in ur spare time do these things
> watch prime movies
> call anyone or someone spcl... ;)
> watch Man of Iron Fist.. F.R.I.E.N.D.S. or G.O.T.... Bhabhi ji...
> Enjoy the trips...go to chilkur after vinay's arrival
> 


Preapare yourself for:::::
1. Upcoming trips. Must be muscular...biceps
2. Learn everyday something new..
3. Save ur energy for ur finale....otherwise ur performance will be bad...
   That day's performance matters a lot....so save for at least 6 month..then u will hv best experience of life...BEST means BESTTTT...so whenever any thought comes just start thinking about ur that day.
