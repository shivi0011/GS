What’s Your “One Word” for the Year Ahead?

Have you heard of the “one word” challenge? People pray for one word that encapsulates what they want to work on this year.

I definitely know my one word for the next year. It’s PASSION. I’ve felt lately that I need more passion in my life: 
passion for God, passion for nature, passion for my husband, passion for my family. I’ve been living my life lately too much by 
rote, pushing myself to do what needs to get done, and I’ve forgotten how to be passionate about it.


For me one word would be CSE.....I wont leave without giving it a chance....
