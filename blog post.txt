Whenever we see romantic or love-o-matic situation around us in the breezing air, we feel a bizarre kind of feeling that kaaaashh I'd be the part of such things in my life too. It used to happen in everybody's life But they never look into their life because in today's world everybody is more interested in others life rather than concentrating on his own life. 


Sometimes we feel very bad due to happening of unexpectedly expected things in life which directly attacks on your heart n mind. Those situations makes us to deplore for some time, we feel annoyed, angry, sometimes we lost our senses even sometimes situation got more worst, we felt like everything is finished, this is the end of the world.

But that's not the reality, things are still there, we have to face them. Without facing the situation we shouldn't quit. 

 

Always remember --

First good thing to do --- DOing right things.

Second good thing --- DOing wrong things --- it means you are trying at least and always remember edison's words 

 

    "I haven't failed I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work". 

 

These words works in every odd situations....to make the odds into the even.

 

and worst thing --- not doing anything.


It means at least you must try to get whatever you want to achieve. Hard endeavor never goes in vain.  


Why we never concentrate on the things which we have, we always compete for the things which are more shiner from the outlook. We never look at the inner beauty. 

So keep making the odds into even by looking around you. You will surely find the solutions.

Because "This is not the end of the world" !!
